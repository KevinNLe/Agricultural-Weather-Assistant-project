The Agricultural Weather Assistant is a tool or system designed to help farmers make smarter decisions by turning complex weather and environmental data into simple, actionable insights. It collects information such as temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind, and soil moisture from sources like weather APIs, IoT sensors, or AWS Data Exchange datasets, then analyzes it to provide guidance on key farming activities.
