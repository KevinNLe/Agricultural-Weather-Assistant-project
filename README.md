🌾 Agricultural Weather Assistant

Co-Founders: Kevin Le & Ethan Park

The Agricultural Weather Assistant is a smart, data-driven tool designed to help farmers make better decisions by transforming complex weather and environmental data into simple, actionable insights. Our goal is to support agricultural communities with clearer guidance, improved planning, and more sustainable outcomes.

🚜 What It Does

The system collects and analyzes key environmental data—including temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind speed, and soil moisture—from sources such as:

Weather APIs

IoT sensors

AWS Data Exchange datasets

Using this data, the tool generates easy-to-understand recommendations for important farming activities, such as:

Optimal irrigation timing

Planting and harvesting windows

Frost or heat-risk alerts

Soil health insights

🌦️ Why It Matters

Farmers often deal with unpredictable weather and overwhelming data. The Agricultural Weather Assistant simplifies all of that, helping farmers reduce risk, save time, and make confident decisions that directly impact crop health and productivity.
