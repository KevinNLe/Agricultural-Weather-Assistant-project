🌾 Agricultural Weather Assistant

Co-Founders: Kevin Le & Ethan Park

The Agricultural Weather Assistant is a tool we built to help farmers make smarter, easier decisions by turning complicated weather data into simple insights they can actually use. Instead of having to sort through temperature charts, rainfall numbers, and humidity levels on their own, this system does the heavy lifting and presents the information in a way that makes sense.

🚜 What It Does
- We collect key weather data—like temperature, humidity, rainfall, and wind speed—from datasets and IoT sensors. Then, using our code, we calculate daily hazard levels based on those conditions. This helps farmers understand when the weather might pose risks to their crops.

- Temperature & Humidity Over Time: Shows how these conditions changed throughout the past month in Charlotte.

- Rainfall & Wind Speed Trends: Helps us see patterns in weather behavior and how they connect to potential risks.

- Daily Risk Analysis: Displays the danger levels for temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The orange line shows the total risk score each day, combining all three factors on a 0–100 scale.

🌦️ Why It Matters
- Farmers deal with unpredictable weather every single day, and managing that uncertainty can be stressful. Our goal is to turn overwhelming data into helpful guidance—things like:

- When to irrigate

- The best times to plant or harvest

- Alerts for heat, frost, or strong winds

- Early signs of conditions that might harm crops
